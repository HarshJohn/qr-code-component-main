## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to utilize custom css properties that I learned in my previous project in this project.
I was able to use flexbox to center the element where margin was not working.
I was able to make website responsive, even though there was not so much work.

I learned something about git and github along with the project which is most important lesson from this simple challenge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
:root {
    --ff: 'Outfit', sans-serif;

    --fs-reg: 400;
    --fs-bold: 700;

    --bg-clr-light: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --bg-clr-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --bg-clr-grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --bg-clr-dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

    --fs-h1: 1.25rem;
    --fs-body: 15px;

    --ws-mobile: 375px;
    --ws-desktop: 1440px;
}

```
### Continued development

The responsiveness of a website is one of the most important feature. I think I am getting a hang of this feature.

I'll continue to work and improve along with some complicated challenges.
